== Introduction

The Java CLI is a Java library and a command line interface that provides many common operation on a SWAMP instance.  These operations include getting a list of projects, packages, versions of packages, assessments, tools and platforms.  User can also create packages, upload new versions of a package, configure and start an assessment, check the status of an assessment, and download SCARF results.

== Running the CLI
Pre-requisites for the latest CLI is JDK-8.

=== Download the latest Java CLI

From https://github.com/mirswamp/java-cli/releases page, download the latest archive for java-cli-X.Y-jar-with-dependencies.zip archive, where X.Y stands for the latest release. Extract/Unarchive the zip file to get the jar file for the CLI.


Run the following command to test if it works.

```
java -jar java-cli-1.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

The output of the above command must be
```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: <program> <sub-command> <options>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<sub-command> must be one of the following:
		login
		logout
		assess
		project
		package
		platform
		results
		status
		tools
		user
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For information on the <options> for a <sub-command> execute:
	<program> <sub-command> --help or <program> <sub-command> -h
```

Java CLI provides sub-commands to perform various operations on SWAMP. The sub-command is the first argument to the CLI program. Each sub-command has its own set of options and arguments

=== Login to SWAMP

`login` sub-command must be used to login into SWAMP. The `login` sub-command takes the following options:

[cols="<40%,<60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option | Value
| `--console` | Accepts username and password from the terminal
| `--filepath <CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH>` | Properties file containing
                                        *username* and *password*
| `--swamp-host <SWAMP_HOST>` | URL for SWAMP host. This is optional, default is `https://www.mir-swamp.org`
| `-help` | get help on options
|=======================================================================

The properties file should have the following as key value pairs:
```
username=<swamp-username>
password=<swamp-password>
```

If the login is successfull, the following output is displayed on the console.
```
Login successful
User UUID: <SWAMP user UUID>
```

=== SWAMP Projects

`project` sub-command must be used for the following:
* Get the list of all the SWAMP project the user is part of.
* Given a project name, get the project UUID.

The `project` sub-command takes the following options:

[cols="<40%,<60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option | Value
| `--list` | shows all the project names that user is associated with along with their UUIDs
| `--project-name <PROJECT_NAME>` | Name of the project to get the UUID for
| `--help` | get help on options
|=======================================================================

=== SWAMP Platforms

`platform` sub-command must be used for the following:

* Get a list of all the platforms supported by the SWAMP instance.
* Given a platform name, get the platform UUID.

The `platform` sub-command takes the following options:

[cols="<40%,<60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option | Value
| `--list` | show all the platforms supported by the SWAMP instance along with their UUIDs
| `--platform-name <PLATFORM_NAME>` | Name of the platform to get the UUID for
| `--help` | get help on options
|=======================================================================


=== SWAMP Tools

`tools` sub-command must be used for the following:

* Get a list of all the tools supported by the SWAMP instance.
* Given a tool,m name, get the platform UUID.

The `tools` sub-command takes the following options:

|Option | Value
| `--list` | show all the tools supported by the SWAMP instance along with their UUIDs, supported package types, and supported platforms
| `--tool-name <TOOL_NAME>` | Name of the tool to get the UUID for
| `--project-uuid <PROJECT_UUID>` | Project UUID for extra project specific tools, this option must be used along with the `--list` option
| `--help` | get help on options
|=======================================================================

=== SWAMP Package

`package` sub-command must be used for the following:

* Upload a package to SWAMP
* List supported package types
* List all the packages in a project
* Delete a set of package from a project

To *upload* a package, the `package` sub-command takes the following options:

[cols="<40%,<60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option | Value
| `--pkg-archive <PACKAGE_ARCHIVE_FILEPATH>` | Path to the archive of the package.
| `--pkg-conf <PACKAGE_CONF_FILEPATH>` | Path to package.conf file for the package.
| `--new-pkg` | Flag to specify if this should be a new package, instead of a package version. If a package with the same name already exist, it is added as a package version. This flag is optional

| `--project-uuid <PROJECT_UUID>` | UUID of the project tht this must be associated with
|=======================================================================

To display the *types of software packages* supported by SWAMP, the `package` sub-command takes the following options:
[cols="<40%,<60%",options="header",]

=== Build status on Travis CI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mirswamp/java-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mirswamp/java-cli)

=== Automated Test Suite

To run the automated test suite, do the following:

* Change to `java-cli` directory
* From `https://github.com/mirswamp/java-cli/releases`, download `test_packages.zip` file and unzip it in `scripts/resources` directory.
* Download *Jython-2.7.0* stand-alone jar file from http://www.jython.org/downloads.html and create a JYTHON_JAR environment variable that points to the Jar file.
* Create a `userinfo.properties` in `scripts/resources` directory. The file should have the following as key value pairs
```
username=<swamp-username>
password=<swamp-password>
project=<swamp-user-project-uuid>
hostname=<swamp-hostname> # Optional, default is mir-swamp.org
```
* run `.scripts/test.sh` script.
