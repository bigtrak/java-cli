In the SWAMP backend, a software package to be assessed has three components:

1. The package archive file
2. `package.conf` file
3. `pkg-os-dependencies.conf` file

`package.conf` file for a package contains meta data about the package primarly on how to configure and build the package. A package.conf file may has following entries in the `key=value` format:

[cols="<25%,<25%",options="header",]
